#Ball_moving
**Description:**

     This HTML page features a bouncing red ball animation. JavaScript controls the ball's position, direction, and speed within a predefined rectangular area. The ball moves horizontally and vertically, reversing direction when hitting the boundaries. The setInterval function triggers the animation every 500 milliseconds, creating a continuous bouncing effect on the webpage.
**How to run:**

     step1:-Save the HTML file with .html extension.
     step2:-Install the Live server Extension.
     step3:-After installing the Live Server extension,"Go Live" button at the bottom right corner of the VSCode window.
     Click the "Go Live" button.
     step4:-A new browser window will open, displaying  Ball- moving animation.
**Future improvement:**   

      future improvement, consider adding user interaction features like mouse or keyboard control to change the ball's direction or speed, or adding obstacles or targets for the ball to interact with, creating a more engaging and interactive animation.
